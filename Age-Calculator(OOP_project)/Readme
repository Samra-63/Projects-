## Age Calculator GUI â€” OOP Semester Project

This project is a Java Swing application developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming course. It calculates the exact age between two dates with a graphical interface, allowing users to determine how old they will be (or were) on any specific date.

### Project Overview

The application enables users to:

* Enter their date of birth (DOB).
* Specify a target date to calculate their age at that moment.
* View the difference in years, months, days, total days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

The interface provides real-time date validation, highlighting invalid inputs and ensuring only correct dates are used for calculations.

### Key Features

* Interactive GUI: Built with Java Swing components such as `JFrame`, `JPanel`, `JComboBox`, `JTextField`, and `JButton`.
* Accurate Calculations: Uses `LocalDate` and `Period` from the `java.time` package to handle complex date differences reliably.
* Detailed Output: Displays the calculated age in multiple formats for comprehensive results.
* Date Validation: Checks for invalid dates like February 30, incorrect day/month combinations, and unreasonable years.

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `Main.java` file:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
  
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the program:

   javac Main.java

4. Run the application:

   java Main

### Technologies Used

* Java SE
* Swing for GUI
* `java.time` API for date calculations

### Learning Outcomes

This project strengthened my understanding of:

* Event-driven programming with Java Swing
* Managing user input in GUIs
* Working with date and time in Java
* Structuring an object-oriented program with proper design
